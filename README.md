# Apple Mac Landing Page

### Project Overview
This project is a sleek, minimal landing page inspired by Apple's iconic design aesthetics. The page features a clean, modern look with smooth animations that bring a 3D model of the MacBook Pro to life as you scroll. The MacBook opens to reveal the screen, creating an immersive experience. Stylish text gradients and seamless transitions make the page feel polished and elegant, staying true to Apple's design principles.


### Features
- **3D MacBook Animation**: A scroll-triggered animation opens the MacBook Pro to reveal the screen, enhancing visual engagement.
- **Smooth Animations**: Subtle, fluid animations give the page a refined feel.
- **Gradient Text Styling**: A stylish gradient applied to the text adds a modern touch.
- **Responsive Design**: The landing page is fully responsive and optimized for various screen sizes.

### Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Provides the basic structure for the webpage.
- **CSS3**: Used for styling, including gradients, animations, and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Handles scroll-triggered animations for an interactive experience.
- **Three.js (Optional)**: If used, it powers the 3D model and its animation.
